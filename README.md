# Blackjack
Developers:
John Schmitt,
Daniel Choi,
Charles Fannin

This one our team's first small project used to get to know each other and to familiarize ourselves with github.
It is a simple Blackjack game.

Daniel Choi was responsible for the layouts, resources, restoring game state from files, card shuffling, game phases, and UX.
Charles Fannin was responsible for assigning the card resources into a two-dimensional array and saving the values into a file.
John Schmitt was responsible for handling the computer's turn, helped with game phase, and code cleanup.
